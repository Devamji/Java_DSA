A String is a non-primitive data type used to store a sequence of characters (text). It is immutable, meaning once created, it cannot be changed.

Key Points:
•	String is a class in java.lang package.
•	Strings are objects, not primitive types.
•	You can create a string using double quotes (" ").

Why String is Immutable?
•	Security: Used in class loading, file paths, network connections, etc.
•	Thread Safety: Multiple threads can safely use strings.
•	Performance: JVM can reuse string literals via String Pool.
